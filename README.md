### Enable HTTPS (only to phpserver)
To enable the HTTPS Protocol, *before running docker-compose*, create the path `app/certificates` and put your SSL Certificates there. Then, uncomment the SSL Section on `app/Dockerfile` (make sure that the certificate file names are the same as in the Dockerfile). Also uncomment the HTTPS Port on `docker-compose.yml`.  After running the docker-compose you should be able to access [https://localhost](https://localhost).
